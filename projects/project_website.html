        <h1>Welcome to my portfolio</h1>
        <p>As Junior year Information Management and Technology major at Syracuse University, I have had the opportunity to have experience with coding, computer networking, application programming, project managemnt, information management, information security and data analysis. I have experience with team-oriented work, and possess great communication skills, learned through work experience, group projects, coaching, and presenting courses. I have studied abroad in Madrid, Spain at Instituto Internacional, and was able to learn a lot of about Spanish Culture and their way of life. When I am not working or studying, I love to listen to music, travel, play sports and socialize with my friends. My favorite type of music is Hip Hop. My favorite place in the world is Madrid, Spain. I plan on traveling there again this year, and my dream would be to move there when I am older. I love to play and watch basketball all the time and like to exercise daily. I have 1 brother and a dog(being my favorite member of the family).</p>
